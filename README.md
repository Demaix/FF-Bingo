**FF Bingo**

This is the code for a Discord bot with many functions. Mostly the bot is intended to create and dispense bingo cards!
The code creates files for each server it is in so card pools and images are separated by server.


**Usage**

To use script make sure all packages in the `requirements.txt` are installed and run `main.py`. 
You will have to setup your own Discord Bot account, to get this code to run on the bot you must set an environment
variable `BINGO_BOT_TOKEN` to your Discord Bot token. This can be done in a `.env` file in the root folder.
